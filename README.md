# HanabiAnalysis

For my senior project, I independently developed a Python script that analyzed log files from 'Hanabi' games played between a human and three different AI types. While my professor provided the overall direction for the project, I wrote the code myself with minimal assistance. My script visualized behavioral differences between the AI types using bar graphs generated with Pythonâ€™s matplotlib library. You can see the results of my analysis here:

Directions for running my project:

1. Have hanabi game logs in a directory called "logs"

2. Have HanabiAnalysis.py and DeckRandomizer.py in the same directory "logs" is located

3. Run DeckRandomizer.py on python 2.7 to make a randomized deck + starting hands. Files will be placed into a directory called "decks".

4. Run HanabiAnalyzer.py using python versions 3.0 and up. Each log file should have a matching deck file created by DeckRandomizer.py

5. Pick 3 AI's to analyze after executing the code separated by space e.g. intentional outer full

6. Pick which difficulty you would like to observe, beg or exp
